# Whispers of the Dawn

# The sky begins to softly glow,
# As morning winds begin to flow.
# A bird sings out, so pure, so clear,
# A melody for all to hear.

# The world awakes, both calm and bright,
# Embraced within the tender light.
# And in that quiet, peaceful space,
# We find our hearts, a warm embrace.
